Families with children who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals and who do NOT get CalFresh, Medi-Cal or Foster Care benefits must apply online before July 15, 2020. Families can get up to $365 for each child who is eligible for P-EBT benefits. As long as families apply before July 15th, 2020, you will get the full amount of benefits for all four months. The total amount you will get depends on how many eligible children are living in your home. For each eligible child, your card will be paid the following each month: \r\nMarch 2020: $68 per child\r\nApril 2020: $120 per child\r\nMay 2020: $120 per child\r\nJune 2020: $57 per child\r\nThis means each eligible child will get a total of up to $365 in P-EBT benefits over a four month period.",
